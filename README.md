📌 Abstract
This paper investigates the integration of AI tools across the entire Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) within a cloud-native environment. It outlines how AI enhances each stage—requirement analysis, design, implementation, testing, and maintenance—while also addressing practical implementation hurdles such as skill gaps, data quality, integration complexity, and ethical considerations.

🧩 Key Contributions
Analyzed the impact of AI on traditional SDLC models in cloud-native contexts.

Provided strategies to mitigate challenges such as ethical dilemmas, scalability, and organizational readiness.

Outlined a roadmap for AI implementation throughout the SDLC using case-driven research methodology.
